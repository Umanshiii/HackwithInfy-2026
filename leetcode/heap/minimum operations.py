'''
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, and an integer k.

You are allowed to perform some operations on nums, where in a single operation, you can:

Select the two smallest integers x and y from nums.
Remove x and y from nums.
Insert (min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)) at any position in the array.
Note that you can only apply the described operation if nums contains at least two elements.
